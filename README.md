# ☕ Chai Engine

**Chai** is a modular C++ game engine built from scratch for experimenting with real-time rendering, traversal mechanics, and non-Euclidean level design.

---

## ✨ Overview

Chai is my personal playground for exploring engine architecture and gameplay systems. It's written in modern C++, with a focus on clean structure, rendering abstraction, and extensibility.

---

## 🧱 Features

- 🔧 **Abstract Rendering Layer**  
  Decouples rendering from logic; supports multiple backends (OpenGL now, Vulkan in progress)

- 🌀 **Coordinate System Abstraction**  
  (In planning) Enables traversal and rendering in spherical, hyperbolic, or Euclidean space

- 🧠 **Modular Engine Architecture**  
  Systems like input, events, and scene management are built to be extensible and loosely coupled

- 🎮 **Frame-Based Simulation**  
  Designed for real-time responsiveness and gameplay experimentation

- 📐 **Custom Math Layer**  
  Lightweight 3D math utilities with future support for non-standard geometry

---

## 🔜 Roadmap

- [ ] Add Vulkan backend support  
- [ ] Build traversal-focused test scenes  
- [ ] Add component system for gameplay objects  
- [ ] Develop basic in-editor tools and camera systems  
- [ ] Coordinate system layer for runtime switching

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++ 
- **Rendering:** OpenGL (GLFW)  
- **UI:** ImGui or Nuklear
- **Build:** CMake  
- **Utilities:** Custom math & event libraries

## 💡 Why Chai?

I built Chai as a way to learn by doing—by reimagining what a game engine could look like if it were designed around experimentation, not constraints. Chai helps me grow as a programmer, deepen my graphics knowledge, and explore gameplay mechanics that don’t fit neatly into existing engines.

## 📎 Notes

Chai is very much a work in progress. More coming soon!
